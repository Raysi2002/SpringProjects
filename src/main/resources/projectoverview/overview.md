Blog Management System Overview

The Blog Management System is designed to allow users to create, manage, and retrieve blog posts efficiently. It will support features like categorization, tagging, filtering, and pagination, making it a practical project for practicing API development.

Features Breakdown
1.	CRUD Operations for Posts
‚Ä¢	Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.
‚Ä¢	Each post includes attributes like title, content, author, creation date, and modification date.
2.	Categories for Posts
‚Ä¢	Organize posts into predefined categories like ‚ÄúTech,‚Äù ‚ÄúLifestyle,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHealth.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Each post belongs to one category, helping in better organization and filtering.
3.	Tagging Posts with Multiple Tags
‚Ä¢	Tags allow flexible classification. For example, a ‚ÄúTech‚Äù post can have tags like ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù ‚ÄúProgramming,‚Äù or ‚ÄúStartups.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Posts can have multiple tags, and tags can belong to multiple posts.
4.	API to Fetch Posts by Category, Tag, or Date
‚Ä¢	Endpoints to filter posts based on:
‚Ä¢	Category (e.g., fetch all ‚ÄúTech‚Äù posts).
‚Ä¢	Tag (e.g., fetch all posts tagged with ‚ÄúAI‚Äù).
‚Ä¢	Date range (e.g., fetch posts published between two dates).
5.	Pagination for Large Lists of Posts
‚Ä¢	Divide long lists of posts into manageable chunks.
‚Ä¢	Provide query parameters like page and size for pagination.

created_at  TIMESTAMP
updated_at  TIMESTAMP


	2.	Posts Table

id          INT PRIMARY KEY
title       VARCHAR(255)
content     TEXT
author_id   INT (Foreign Key to Users.id, optional)
category_id INT (Foreign Key to Categories.id)
created_at  TIMESTAMP
updated_at  TIMESTAMP


	3.	Categories Table

id          INT PRIMARY KEY
name        VARCHAR(100)
description TEXT


	4.	Tags Table

name        VARCHAR(100)


	5.	Post_Tags Table (Join Table for Many-to-Many Relationship)

post_id     INT (Foreign Key to Posts.id)
tag_id      INT (Foreign Key to Tags.id)
PRIMARY KEY (post_id, tag_id)

Implementation Plan
1.	Set Up Database:
‚Ä¢	Design and create tables based on the schema.
‚Ä¢	Add sample data for testing.
2.	Build APIs:
‚Ä¢	Start with CRUD operations for Posts.
‚Ä¢	Implement filtering by category, tag, and date.
‚Ä¢	Add pagination support.
3.	Test and Refine:
‚Ä¢	Test each endpoint with tools like Postman.
‚Ä¢	Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid category/tag IDs).
4.	Enhance:
‚Ä¢	Add optional features like User authentication or comments.
